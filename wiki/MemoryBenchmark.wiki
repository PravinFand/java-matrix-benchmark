#summary Summary of memory usage benchmark.

= Introduction =

How much memory a library uses can be a significant factor, especially when dealing with larger matrices.  It is often the case that faster algorithms require more memory to cache results or to make a concurrent algorithm faster.  If a library requires so much memory that it cannot run on your system then it simply cannot be used.

= Procedure =

Several operations are tested in each library.
