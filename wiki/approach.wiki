Java Matrix Benchmark is a tool for evaluating different Java matrix libraries for speed and stability.  This is accomplished through two benchmarks, runtime and stability.  The runtime benchmark attempts to measure the best possible runtime performance for different linear algebra operations in each library.  The stability benchmark tests different common linear algebra solvers for stability and accuracy using general purpose tests.

Performance results are presented using relative runtime plots and tables.  Relative runtime plots show how fast each library performs relative to other libraries.  They do NOT show the FLOPS for each library.  Stability benchmarks are presented using tables.  These tables show either the accuracy or the breaking point of each algorithm as well as errors that occurred during testing.

The following pages provide more information on the specific benchmarks.  Links to the methodology go into detain about how the results are computed.  Links to the descriptions describe what was benchmarked and how to understand the results.
