- benchmark java version of UJMP
- remember amount of memory previously allocated for a particular matrix size
- only plot results if errors don't exist
- use BigDecimal to compute accuracy of libraries
- stability of BigDecimal matrices?

- convert results to excel format

- Create a memory leak test

- Note some place that EJML is always included so libraries that depend on it will use whatever version
the benchmark is using
