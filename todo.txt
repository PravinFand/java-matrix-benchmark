- flush memory between trials on slave
- only plot results if errors don't exist
- use BigDecimal to compute accuracy of libraries
- stability of BigDecimal matrices?
- stability for jblas

- option to not run correctness check on data

- convert results to excel format

- determine memory requirements

- Note some place that EJML is always included so libraries that depend on it will use whatever version
the benchmark is using
