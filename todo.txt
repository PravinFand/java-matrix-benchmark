- Consider matrices up to 5000
- remove LU,QR,Cholesky decomposition from runtime
- remove JScience
- flush memory between trials on slave
- only plot results if errors don't exist
- use BigDecimal to compute accuracy of libraries
- stability of BigDecimal matrices?
- stability for jblas
- Optionally exclude or include native libraries when plotting
- command line interface for running benchmarks from jar
  * Specify directory to resume
  * Specify config file to use
  * min and max matrix size
  * Libraries to include
  * quick and dirty results

- determine memory requirements
